## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Form Validation
```typescript
// Real-time password validation
const passwordRequirements = [
  { test: (pw: string) => pw.length >= 8, label: "At least 8 characters" },
  { test: (pw: string) => /[A-Z]/.test(pw), label: "One uppercase letter" },
  // ... more requirements
];
```

### Welcome Panel Logic
```typescript
// Show welcome panel for new users only
{(!cvms || cvms.length === 0) && !isLoading && (
  <WelcomePanel 
    username={user.name}
    hasPaymentMethod={user.hasPayment}
    hasCVMs={false}
  />
)}
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **A/B Testing**: Implement these changes gradually with split testing
2. **User Research**: Gather feedback from real users on the improved flows
3. **Analytics**: Monitor conversion metrics and user behavior changes
4. **Iteration**: Continuously improve based on data and feedback
